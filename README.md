## Interview
Hello!  In the rush that is the start of the term, I really haven't had a chance to chat with many of you.  So would you do me the favor of helping me get to know a bit about you by answering the following?  Please avoid one word answers... I want to learn about you!

Q1: So you're finishing up your time in this CSCC program.  Why did you decide to embark on this journey?
    
    Because I work in a help desk role and it's kinda wack.
    
Q2: I _love_ to travel.  Tell me a bit about your favorite travel destination so far.  What's on your travel bucket list?
    
    Toronto, Canada. Very fun and diverse city. I would love to go to Tokyo one day.
    
Q3: Name your favorite member of [The Beatles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles), and your favorite Beatles song.  You do know at least one Beatles song, right?  If you are a Beatles fan, feel free to give me your top 5 or so.
    
    Uh.... John Lennon... I guess. I know that Yellow Submarine is a thing. As you can tell I'm not a Beatles fan.
    
Q4: Do you have any pets? Species/Name/Details please. [Murray](images/Murray.jpeg?raw) wants to know... (he's not as smart as that picture makes him seem). 
    
    I don't have any pets, I'm allergic to everything.
